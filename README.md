# MendicantBias

Mendicant Bias is a discord bot written in Java using JDA. Currently on it's second iteration as the first one was corrupted.

Current basic functionality as of initial commit:

- MyAnimeList search using Jikan4Java.
- Music/Radio support using Lavaplayer.
- User report system 

More to come.

I had to abandon the Mendicant Bias project in summer as final year uni approached, hopefully i can pick it back up in the future or in spare time down the line.
